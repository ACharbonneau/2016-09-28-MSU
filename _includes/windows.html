        <li>Run the installer and follow the steps bellow:
          <ol>

          If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
          <ol>
            <li>Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type <code>cmd</code> and press [Enter])</li>
            <li>
              Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:
              <p><code>setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"</code></p>
            </li>

      <p>This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.</p>
<p>
<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Windows
should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version x.y.z</b>. You
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically.
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>


<p>

<li><b>R</b>
<br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
<ul>
<li>      Download R from
      <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">here</a>
<li>Run the .exe file that was just downloaded
<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download page</a>
<li>Under <i>Installers</i> select <b>RStudio 0.98.1103 - Windows XP/Vista/7/8</b>
<li>Double click the file to install it
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
</ul>
